# Please see instructions (pdf). You can run the code on Jyupterhub (own login, see link instructions) or on your own PC and python set-up by downloading .ipynb or .py. The code can be modified beyond the structural parameters. 
1.	The link to Jupyterhub is https://tinyurl.com/TFY4255-lab2-code.

      a.      Once you click the link to Jupyterhub, you will be redirected to the login webpage, where you must type a username and password for the Jupyterhub account.  Sign up with the Blackboard username and choose a password for yourself. You can use these credentials to log in to this webpage.

  	b.      Once you log in successfully, you can see a Jupyter Notebook opened in a tab. Make sure that there are nine files and one directory in the list on the left panel of the screen.

  	c.	 Now, you must choose the correct kernel for running the code. For this, click kernel (it should start with “Python xx”), given at the top right corner of the Jupyter Notebook tab. Now you get a small window with a drop-down menu, from which you can choose the kernel “Python [conda env:tfy4255]”. 

      d.	Now everything is set for you to run the notebook. The specific information to work with the notebook is already given at the beginning of the Jupyter Notebook. Please read it carefully.
